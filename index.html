        <h2><span>Jamie Floyd:</span> <em>Upper West Side Classic 6</em></h2>
        <p>
          "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
          eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for
          anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
          Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"
        </p>
        <h2><span>Donna and Scott:</span> <em> Rescued Renovation</em></h2>
        <p>
          "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
          great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet
          before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond,"
          but on HGTV or TLC!"
        </p>
        <h2><span>David Siegel:</span> <em> Doubled the Value</em></h2>
        <p>
          "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
          pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his
          gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make
          home improvements."
